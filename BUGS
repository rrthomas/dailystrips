  Script does not seem to work on Perl 5.0 due to <code:> parser

1.0.13
  04 June 2001
  The new <code:> feature seems to be ok. The only issue may be the escaping of
  > symbols in the code. I think I've handled it properly - let me know if there
  are any problems or if there's a better way.

  sfgate still isn't working right. They seem to have devised some way of
  only allowing strip images to be downloaded when you're actually looking
  at the webpage. It's more sophisticated that just checking the referer
  (which is already handled) - but I'm sure it will be figured out soon
  enough.

  Since the program does not keep track of which options you use when running in
  local mode, changing options from one day to the next (such as using
  --dailydir one day and --stripdir the next) will prevent it from being able to
  check for duplicates that time. Unless you switch options every day, though,
  this shouldn't really be a problem.

  When using the --date option, the program downloads strips that may not be for
  the correct day anyway (such as searching an index.html page, as opposed to
  a %Y%m%d.html page). The definitions should declare whether or not they can
  find a strip for a specific day, or just the latest one. - FIXED in 1.0.16

1.0.8

  Need better error handling with the LWP::UserAgent module (if there's a
  problem, report exactly *what* went wrong - proxy, etc..)

  The definition file parsing code needs to be re-thought and re-done. It works,
  but gets weird in places and is generally hard to maintain.

  One thing I should have mentioned for 1.0.4 is that the defs file parsing code
  gives completely erroneous line numbers (they represent the lines of the file
  after removing blank line and comment lines) and should be dealt with. -
  FIXED in 1.0.16


1.0.6
  02 Feb 2001
  It's not actually a bug in the program, but I'd like to advise users anyway
  that something is wrong at sfgate.com, so none of the strips from that site
  are available. (19 Feb 2001 - not surprisingly, all is well now)

1.0.4
  26 Jan 2001:

  The definition file-parsing code, while it works fine on correctly formatted
  files, weird things may happen with improperly formatted files (most obvious
  problems are checked for, but not all may be caught).

1.0.0:
  20 Jan 2001:

  The command-line option parsing stuff works for me, but it really isn't
  "right". For example, it's impossible to use --output with --local.
  Also, "--quiet" won't work completely if specified last. This section
  needs a complete rethink to operate optimally. - FIXED in 1.0.2

  If an image doesn't download (404 error), but the remote webserver returns
  a custom 404 page, this 404 page gets saved as the image, causing a "broken"
  image. This should be detected. - FIXED in 1.0.1
