1.0.8
  20 Feb 2001
  Need better error handling with the LWP::UserAgent module (if there's a problem,
  report exactly *what* went wrong - proxy, etc..)

  The definition file parsing code needs to be re-thought and re-done. It works,
  but gets weird in places and is generally hard to maintain.

  One thing I should have mentioned for 1.0.4 is that the defs file parsing code
  gives completely erroneous line numbers (they represent the fines of the file
  after removing blank line and comment lines) and should be dealt with.

1.0.6

  It's not actually a bug in the program, but I'd like to advise users anyway
  that something is wrong at sfgate.com, so none of the strips from that site
  are available.

1.0.4
  26 Jan 2001:

  The definition file-parsing code, while it works fine on correctly formatted
  files, weird things may happen with improperly formatted files (most obvious
  problems are checked for, but not all may be caught).

1.0.0:
  20 Jan 2001:

  The command-line option parsing stuff works for me, but it really isn't
  "right". For example, it's impossible to use --output with --local.
  Also, "--quiet" won't work completely if specified last. This section
  needs a complete rethink to operate optimally. - FIXED in 1.0.2

  If an image doesn't download (404 error), but the remote webserver returns
  a custom 404 page, this 404 page gets saved as the image, causing a "broken"
  image. This should be detected. - FIXED in 1.0.1
