This is mostly my rambling, but feel free to implement anything you want to
tackle..

1.0.9
  24 Feb 2001
  Now that a group capability has been added to the definition file, it appears
  necessary to support some sort of 'local' or personal definition file, in
  addition to the distributed one. If only a single file was supported, anyone
  with custom groups would have to copy/paste them from the old file into the
  new whenever they upgraded the definition file. I'd do this now, but it's 3AM
  and I need the sleep. - DONE in 1.0.14

1.0.6
  02 Feb 2001
  Since the program is starting to get rather large and handles so many
  different options, it looks like it may be a good idea to split it up into
  several smaller programs programs to each handle a specific task. I'll be
  starting a developmemt branch shortly to get started on this.

  Look into using the getopts perl module for getting command-line parameters.

1.0.4
  26 Jan 2001
  Revise definitions file parsing code (functional but messy..)

  Implement an option to remove files older than a set number of days (for
  example, anything more than a week old). This would conserve disk space when
  downloading a large number of strips daily.

  Add a 'group' section to strips.def where you can specify an alias (such as
  "tech") that would stand for several strips (such as "userfriendly",
  "joyoftech", and "badtech") - DONE in 1.0.9

1.0.1
  22 Jan 2001
  Test on Win32 & MacOS

1.0.0:
  20 Jan 2001
  Need to detect failure to download images (for local mode, to avoid 'broken'
  images) - DONE in 1.0.1

  It would be nice to detect duplicate images when in local mode and just
  symlink to the previous file (to save disk space). This applies to semi-
  daily strips only. - DONE in 1.0.5

  Idea: expand to modes of operation other than just generating an HTML
  page, such as emailing the strips (either as attachments (hard) or
  as an HTML page with links to copies on the server)

  Another mode: CGI (possible methods: download on demand, once per day; or
  always re-download on demand (for high-bandwidth users only))

  Change wget to use LWP (for portability) - DONE in 1.0.1

  Change `date +%..` to use Perl builtin (for portability) - DONE in 1.0.1
