1.0.8
  20 Feb 2001
  Added HTTP proxy server support

  Added 'referer' value to definition file - this can be used if a web server
  refuses to return the image without a referer set. Actually, the program uses
  'homepage' as a default referer - you only need to specify 'referer' if the
  homepage value doesn't work.

  Fixed a bug that was causing problems with image files that have no extension

  With the completion of the above two items, SFGate strips should now work properly.

  Fixed the Avalon High definition

  Cleaned up the definition file parsing code somewhat

1.0.7
  19 Feb 2001
  Added several new strips (total is now 148)

  18 Feb 2001
  Fixed a bug when using the --dailydir option that would make incorrect
  symlinks for duplicate files

  Fixed the sample code in README.LOCAL

1.0.6
  02 Feb 2001
  Added --basedir option. dailystrips will change to the specified directory to
  look for information files and save new files there. This makes possible the
  elimination of lines in cron scripts to manually change to a directory for
  operation.

  31 Jan 2001
  The strips definition file now specifies the frequency that each strip is
  expected to be updated at (just daily/semidaily for now). Now, dailystrips
  will not download the same image two days in a row for a daily strip (which
  previously would happen if it was being run before a strip's website was
  updated with the day's new strip). If youwish to add to the definitions file,
  note that "updated daily" is assumed (being the most common) if no "updated"
  line is present - only "updated semidaily" needs to be specified.

  29 Jan 2001
  Fixed a bug with the new mode of sylinking to previous images (previously,
  if today's image wass a symlink and the program was being run for the second
  time that day,the old file would get overwritten - this has been fixed by
  deleting the symlink before downloading a new strip and doing the comparison.

1.0.5
  29 Jan 2001
  Added sfgate strips & misc others (Dave Tweed)

  28 Jan 2001
  Implemented detection and symlinking for duplicate strip files (Scott Carlson)

1.0.4
  26 Jan 2001
  Added all strips from unitedmedia.com (Joaquín Perez again).

  Implemented strip definitions file to describe strips (instead of having a
  separate subroutine for each strip in the program). See strips.def to see how
  this works

1.0.3
  24 Jan 2001
  Added --dailydir option (Marc Doumayrou)

  Also added links to previous day's page (Marc again), and a link in
  the previous day's page to today's page.

  Added warning/error messages if various operations fail that the user should
  know about

1.0.2
  24 Jan 2001
  Added the rest of the strips at ucomics.com (Joaquín Perez).
  dailystrips now has a total of 38 strips available.

  23 Jan 2001
  Re-did command line options parsing code so that order of commands no longer
  matters

  Added --archive option. This adds a link to the current day's page to the
  file archive.html

  Added --noindex option. This disables symlinking the latest page to 'index.html'

  Various other cleanups

1.0.1
  22 Jan 2001
  No longer uses the external 'date' command. Now, dailystrips should run on
  any platworm where the modules HTTP::Request, LWP::UserAgent, and POSIX are
  available

  Added --save option. This recognizes if a strip has already been
  downloaded for the currect day and saves time/bandwidth by not
  re-downloading

  Added 2 new strips - Garfield & Adam@home

  Various other code cleanups/optimizations

  21 Jan 2001
  No longer uses wget - replaced with LWP
  This enhances portability and also allows for better error handling of
  failed downloads

1.0.0:
  20 Jan 2001
  First public release
