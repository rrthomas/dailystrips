  13 Jan 2002
  Typo in script fixed.

  Previously, if the script was run more than once in a day and downloading of a

  seem to be randomly returning bogus 404s on strip images, possibly with the
  intent of tripping up programs such as this.

  Removed Adventurers, hotzp/Bad Boys of Computer Science (both gone)

1.0.18
  18 Aug 2001
  Changed the behavior of the program to handle strips that don't get updated
  daily in a more intelligent manner. Now the most current strip possible is
  saved. By default, a strip that is the same as the previous day's is still
  displayed but the new '--nostale' option can be used to display an message
  in the HTML output instead when an updated strip is not available. Also, the
  --new option has been removed.

  20 Aug 2001
  Added a --lite option for outputting reduced HTML

  17 Aug 2001
  Continued cleaning up definitions. New total of working strips: 220


1.0.16
  23 Jul 2001
  Fixed reporting of line numbers for errors encountered while parsing
  definitions.

  Strip definitions now specify what they can provide (latest image only
  or the correct strip for any date) so that only strips that can actually
  provide the strip for the requested date are downloaded when using the
  --date option.

  Fixed the --date option yet again. (Peter De Wachter)

  Misc code cleanups

  Better error reporting in the definition parser

  Misc bug fixes

  31 Jul 2001

1.0.15
  13 Jul 2001
  Major change: now installs to system directories instead of one dir.
  This involves:
    -installer script install.pl
    -strips.def goes in /usr/share/dailystrips
    -docs go in /usr/share/doc/dailystrips-VERSION
    -script goes in /usr/bin
   Personal installations are described in the INSTALL file.

   A --useragent option has been added to specify the User-Agent: header.

   Added new strip: jerkcity

   Other small code fixes

   15 Jul 2001
   Proxy authentication changed. Please notify if any problems arise.

   Added 'prefetch' keyword to definition file (see README.DEFS for more)

   SF Gate strips seem to be working again

   Other small code fixes

   19 Jul 2001
   Fixed usage of Date::Parse yet again

   No longer creates index.html when an alternate date is specified (so that it
   will not overwrite the latest symlink if running for an earlier day)

   Fixed syntax checking of http_proxy environment variable

   23 Jul 2001
   Better errors for mis-specified proxy servers

   Misc changes


1.0.14
  12 Jul 2001
  Now uses the strips.def file located in the same directory as the script,
  instead of checking the current directory (Francesco Chemolli)

  Added 'exclude' keyword for defs file (Francesco Chemolli)

  Personal definition files are now supported (~/.dailystrips.defs)


1.0.13
  04 June 2001
  Enchanced the strip definition file a bit (see README.DEFS for more)

  Added The Norm definition

  14 May 2001
  Fixed User Friendly definition

  Fixed routine that checks for presence of Date::Parse module

  Added Dork Tower definition (Mark Larimer)


1.0.12
  11 Mar 2001
  Added --stripdir option to put the files for each strip in a separate
  directory (Daniel Skarda)

  Added --date to specify the date to work with, instead of the current date.
  This works with many strips, but some sites do not provide an HTML page for
  each day (in the case of URLs that must be searched for) or an image
  for each day (in the case of URLs that are generated). Check the definition
  file before using this option, or you may end up downloading current strips
  in addition to strips for the specified date (this requires the Date::Parse
  module from CPAN) (Daniel Skarda)

  Added --verbose option to give extra status information. This is helpful
  if you're trying to figure out what's wrong when a strip won't download.

  Fixed the Dr. Fun definition -  the strip is not updated daily


1.0.11
  07 Mar 2001
  Output no longer contains my name and email, so as not to confuse the
  lawyers.
 

1.0.10
  27 Feb 2001
  Documentation now better explains usage of groups

  Non-date variables now use '$' instead of '%'. Before, when both used '%'
  it was impossible for the script to distinguish between a date variable
  follwed by unrelated text and any other sort of named variable (most
  importantly, this was breaking Sluggy Freelance)

  Added several new strips

  Fixed several strips

  Added --nospaces option (Michael Lewis)

  Added proxy authentication support


1.0.9
  24 Feb 2001
  Added groups support - define multiple strips as one keyword

  Minor code enhancements

  Fixed jokesonyou definition

  21 Feb 2001
  Added Peanuts and everything except Yak's Corner from comicspage.com
  (strip count is now 206)

  Cleaned out a bunch of old code from the script

  Made searchpage the default referer (if different than homepage)

  Added documentation for the strip definition file


1.0.8
  20 Feb 2001
  Added HTTP proxy server support

  Added 'referer' value to definition file - this can be used if a web server
  refuses to return the image without a referer set. Actually, the program uses
  'homepage' as a default referer - you only need to specify 'referer' if the
  homepage value doesn't work.

  Fixed a bug that was causing problems with image files that have no extension

  With the completion of the above two items, SFGate strips should now work
  properly.

  Fixed the Avalon High definition

  Cleaned up the definition file parsing code somewhat


1.0.7
  19 Feb 2001
  Added several new strips (total is now 148)

  18 Feb 2001
  Fixed a bug when using the --dailydir option that would make incorrect
  symlinks for duplicate files

  Fixed the sample code in README.LOCAL


1.0.6
  02 Feb 2001
  Added --basedir option. dailystrips will change to the specified directory to
  look for information files and save new files there. This makes possible the
  elimination of lines in cron scripts to manually change to a directory for
  operation.

  31 Jan 2001
  The strips definition file now specifies the frequency that each strip is
  expected to be updated at (just daily/semidaily for now). Now, dailystrips
  will not download the same image two days in a row for a daily strip (which
  previously would happen if it was being run before a strip's website was
  updated with the day's new strip). If you wish to add to the definitions file,
  note that "updated daily" is assumed (being the most common) if no "updated"
  line is present - only "updated semidaily" needs to be specified.

  29 Jan 2001
  Fixed a bug with the new mode of sylinking to previous images (previously,
  if today's image wass a symlink and the program was being run for the second
  time that day,the old file would get overwritten - this has been fixed by
  deleting the symlink before downloading a new strip and doing the comparison.


1.0.5
  29 Jan 2001
  Added sfgate strips & misc others (Dave Tweed)

  28 Jan 2001
  Implemented detection and symlinking for duplicate strip files (Scott Carlson)


1.0.4
  26 Jan 2001
  Added all strips from unitedmedia.com (Joaquín Perez again).

  Implemented strip definitions file to describe strips (instead of having a
  separate subroutine for each strip in the program). See strips.def to see how
  this works


1.0.3
  24 Jan 2001
  Added --dailydir option (Marc Doumayrou)

  Also added links to previous day's page (Marc again), and a link in
  the previous day's page to today's page.

  Added warning/error messages if various operations fail that the user should
  know about


1.0.2
  24 Jan 2001
  Added the rest of the strips at ucomics.com (Joaquín Perez).
  dailystrips now has a total of 38 strips available.

  23 Jan 2001
  Re-did command line options parsing code so that order of commands no longer
  matters

  Added --archive option. This adds a link to the current day's page to the
  file archive.html

  Added --noindex option. This disables symlinking the latest page to
  'index.html'

  Various other cleanups


1.0.1
  22 Jan 2001
  No longer uses the external 'date' command. Now, dailystrips should run on
  any platworm where the modules HTTP::Request, LWP::UserAgent, and POSIX are
  available

  Added --save option. This recognizes if a strip has already been
  downloaded for the currect day and saves time/bandwidth by not
  re-downloading

  Added 2 new strips - Garfield & Adam@home

  Various other code cleanups/optimizations

  21 Jan 2001
  No longer uses wget - replaced with LWP
  This enhances portability and also allows for better error handling of failed
  downloads


1.0.0:
  20 Jan 2001
  First public release
